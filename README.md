## Real-time "Shane" translator
---
Mostly a gimmick, but it's got some potential, especially for an in-person setting.

- Completely 'dumb', no AI integration, other than to help build it
- Only reacts to pre-programmed trigger words and pre-loaded content
- There is an AI enabled version, but it was just slowing down the reaction time
- This runs completely offline, just uses the browsers built in speech recognition API


 ### Planned Features
 - ui updae
 - easier loading of topics
 - hosting somewhere to ease use?
